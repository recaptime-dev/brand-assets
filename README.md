# @recaptime-dev's brand assets

> Note: This repository does not host our style guide and UI theme kits, but working
on it soon.

Access our brand assets and use it in your project or contribute suggestions here.
We do not accept community contributions for logos and other things relating to
the branding of Recap Time Squad and its covered projects due to how trademarks
work.

Our team will also use this repo to centralize our brand assets across projects,
without the need to copying over and over again.

## Usage

If you need to embed our logos or reuse some of them, following the legalese, use our
Storj DCS-hosted CDN for it, for example:

```
https://brand-assets.storj.rtdevops.net/logos/RecapTimeBot.pnh
```

Alternatively, you can use its rawlink on GitHub and mirrors if you prefer, just
be prepare for breakages when outage happens.
